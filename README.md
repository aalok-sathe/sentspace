## About The Project

`sentspace`
aims to characterize language stimuli using a collection of metrics and comparisons.
Imagine you generated a set of sentences based on some optimization algorithm or extracted 
them from an ANN language model. How do these 'artificially' generated sentences compare to 
naturally occurring sentences?

In the present form of `sentspace`, 
the goal is for a user to feed the toolbox sentences and for the toolbox to return sentence feature values
along the many metrics it implements (and will implementat in the future).

For more information, request read access to the [project doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O1M7T5Ji6KKRvDfI7KQXe_LJ7l9O6_OZA7TEaVP4f8E/edit#).
